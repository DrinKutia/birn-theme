""" Library to implement a well-behaved Unix daemon process

    This library implements PEP 3143: Standard daemon process library.

    A well-behaved Unix daemon process is tricky to get right, but the
    required steps are much the same for every daemon program. A
    `DaemonContext` instance holds the behaviour and configured
    process environment for the program; use the instance as a context
    manager to enter a daemon state.

    Simple example of usage::

        import daemon

        from spam import do_main_program

        with daemon.DaemonContext():
            do_main_program()

    """

from daemon import DaemonContext

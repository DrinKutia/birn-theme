A tiny Django app to do stand-alone email confirmation with no users,
no dependencies, just an object that has an email address.

1. Stick emailconfirmation in your INSTALLED_APPS.

2. Add (r'^', include('emailconfirmation.urls')) to your urls.py.

3. Set EmailConfirmation.after_confirm and
   EmailConfirmation.after_unsubscribe to the name of urls.py entries that
   we will redirect to after successful confirmation and unsubscription.
   These should have a (\d+) somewhere in the URL where the ID of the
   confirmed object will go.

3. Anywhere you want an object that has an email field to be confirmed via
   email, say just after it's been created, simply call:
       EmailConfirmation.objects.confirm(object)
   and return a "Please check your email" page. 'object' here refers 
   to the object being confirmed (which has a foreign key to EmailConfirmation).

   Override emailconfirmation/email.txt to supply your own confirmation email, 
   or pass a Template or template path into confirm().

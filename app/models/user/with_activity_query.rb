# Beta: Add an 'activity' attribute to User to approximate how much the User is
# interacting with the application.
#
# Examples:
#
#   q = User::WithActivityQuery.new
#   q.call
#   # => User::ActiveRecord_Relation
#
#   # ID of most active user:
#   q.call.order('activity DESC').first.id
#   # => 19
#
#   # Activity in date range:
#   q.call(1.month.ago..Time.zone.now)
#   # => User::ActiveRecord_Relation
#
#   # Count of users active in the period
#   # Note the use of `count(:all)` here. I don't fully understand the issue,
#   # but see https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/13648#issuecomment-39352347
#   # for more information.
#   q.call(2.days.ago..1.day.ago).count(:all)
#   #Â => 22
#
#   # Just pluck User id and activity for specific users:
#   q.call.where(:id => [2, 10]).pluck('id, activity')
#   # => [[2, nil],
#   #     [10, 75]]

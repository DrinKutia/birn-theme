It’s the time of year when your site needs to have next year’s public
holiday dates added to it. (It may seem a bit early but the site needs
to know about holidays at least 20 days before the first one takes place
for it to calculate when responses are due properly, and you may need to 
set aside some time to work on this.)

There’s a tool for doing this in the admin interface.
The instructions are here:

Depending on how your site is set up, you should get be able to import the 
holiday dates with the autosuggest feature. If this doesn’t look right, 
you’ll need to add the dates individually using the ‘New holiday’ button for 
each one. Don’t worry about weekends - it won’t hurt the site if you do add
them, it will just take up more of your time! - as the site will work that
out for you, it’s just national holidays that it needs to be told about.

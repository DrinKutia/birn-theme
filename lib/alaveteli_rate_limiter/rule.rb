module AlaveteliRateLimiter
  # Class to encapsulate how many times an event can happen in a given Window.
  class Rule
    # Public: Create a new Rule from a Hash
    #
    # hash - Hash of attributes
    #        :name   - Symbol name of the event
    #        :count  - How many times the event can happen in the window
    #        :window - Options to construct a window
    #          :value - Number of :window_unit that makes up the window
    #          :unit  - One of VALID_UNITS that define the window
    #
    # Example
    #
    #   # Rule that allows an event to happen 10 times in a 1 hour period
    #   new(:name => :test,
    #       :count => 10,
    #       :window => { :value => 1, :unit => :hour })
    #
    # Returns a Rule

  # This function exists to help to keep consistent with the
  # behaviour of earlier versions of Alaveteli: in the code as it
  # is, there are situations where it's expected that we generally
  # have a UTF-8 encoded string, but if the source data was
  # unintepretable under any character encoding, the string may be
  # binary data (i.e. invalid UTF-8).  Such a string would then be
  # mangled into valid UTF-8 by _sanitize_text for the purposes of
  # display.

  # This seems unsatisfactory to me - two better alternatives would
  # be either: (a) to mangle the data into valid UTF-8 in this
  # method or (b) to treat the 'text/*' attachment as
  # 'application/octet-stream' instead.  However, for the purposes
  # of the transition to Ruby 1.9 and/or Rails 3 we just want the
  # behaviour to be as similar as possible.

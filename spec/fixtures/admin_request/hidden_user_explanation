Dear Bob Smith,

Your request 'Foo' at https://test.host/request/foo has been reviewed by moderators.

We consider it to be vexatious, and have therefore hidden it from other users.

You will still be able to view it while logged in to the site. Please reply to this email if you would like to discuss this decision further.

Yours,

The Alaveteli team.

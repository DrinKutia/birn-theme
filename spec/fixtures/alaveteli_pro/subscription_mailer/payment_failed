Dear Paul Pro,

Thank you for your interest in Alaveteli Professional.

We’ve tried to bill your card but the charge was unsuccessful.

We’ll attempt to bill your card again over the coming days.

If payment continues to fail, unfortunately your account will revert back to a free account, and you’ll no longer have access to Alaveteli Professional.

If you wish to preserve your access to Alaveteli Professional, please could you check that your card has sufficient funds, and that the card details are correct on your subscriptions page: http://test.host/en/profile/subscriptions

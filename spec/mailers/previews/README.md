# Preveiewing Mailers

[Action Mailer previews](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#previewing-emails)
provide a way to see how emails look by visiting a special URL that renders
them.

A list of previews are also available at
[`/rails/mailers`](http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers).
